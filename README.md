## ðŸ‘‰ Step 1: Aggregate the Data
### **Objective**
Convert raw transactional data into structured time-series format to prepare for forecasting models.

### **Aggregation Levels:**
- **Daily** â†’ Best for short-term forecasting, inventory planning.
- **Weekly** â†’ Useful for mid-term trend analysis.
- **Monthly / Quarterly** â†’ Helps in long-term sales pattern identification.

### **Outcome**
A structured dataset with consistent time intervals for accurate forecasting.

## ðŸ‘‰ Step 2: Handle Missing Values
### **Objective**
Identify and fill missing values in the dataset to prevent gaps from affecting model predictions.

### **Methods to Handle Missing Data:**
- **Interpolate missing values** â†’ Fill gaps between existing data points.
- **Forward Fill (ffill)** â†’ Carry forward previous day's sales data.
- **Zero-fill** â†’ Set missing values to 0 if SKU was not sold.
- **Impute using historical trends** â†’ Use rolling averages or seasonality-based imputation.

### **Outcome**
A complete dataset without missing values, ensuring consistency in model inputs.

## ðŸ‘‰ Step 3: Detect & Handle Outliers
### **Objective**
Identify and handle extreme values that could distort model performance.

### **How to Handle Outliers:**
- **Keep outliers** if they represent real demand (e.g., promotions, sales spikes).
- **Cap outliers** using Winsorization (limit extreme values to a threshold).
- **Use IQR Method** to detect and remove statistical outliers.

### **Outcome**
A cleaned dataset where extreme values are either treated or accounted for appropriately.

## ðŸ‘‰ Step 4: Transform the Data
### **Objective**
Convert non-normally distributed data into a more stable form to improve model accuracy.

### **Transformation Methods:**
- **Log Transformation (`log1p()`)** â†’ Reduces right-skewed distributions.
- **Square Root Transformation** â†’ Less aggressive than log, useful for moderate skewness.
- **Box-Cox Transformation** â†’ Applies a power transformation, works for positive values.
- **Yeo-Johnson Transformation** â†’ Handles both positive and negative values.

### **Outcome**
A dataset with normalized distributions that improve forecasting performance.

## ðŸ‘‰ Step 5: Scaling the Data
### **Objective**
Ensure that all features have a consistent range to improve model training stability.

### **Choosing the Right Scaling Method:**
- **MinMaxScaler** â†’ Best for deep learning models (LSTM, RNN) and when features have a known fixed range.
- **StandardScaler** â†’ Ideal for normally distributed data, linear regression, and time-series models (ARIMA, SARIMA).
- **RobustScaler** â†’ Best for datasets with outliers, tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest), and robust regression.

### **Outcome**
A properly scaled dataset where all features are optimized for model training.

## ðŸ‘‰ Step 6: Feature Engineering & Train-Test Split (Chronological Order)
### **Objective**
Enhance data with meaningful features and split into training and testing sets while preserving the time-based sequence to prevent data leakage.

### **Feature Engineering for Different Models:**
#### **ðŸ”¢ Traditional Models (ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX)**
- **Lag Features** â†’ Captures previous time steps as predictors.
- **Rolling Averages** â†’ Smooths fluctuations for trend detection.
- **Seasonality Features** â†’ Enhances SARIMA performance with weekly/monthly cycles.
- **External Variables (ARIMAX Only)** â†’ Adds promotions, holidays, or weather.

#### **ðŸŒ¿ Machine Learning Models (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)**
- **Lag Features** â†’ Past values help models recognize patterns.
- **Rolling Averages** â†’ Helps smooth erratic demand.
- **Cyclical Date Features** â†’ Encodes day, month, and week as sine/cosine transformations.
- **External Variables** â†’ Promotional events, holidays, pricing changes.

#### **ðŸ¤– Deep Learning Models (LSTM, Transformers, CNNs)**
- **Lag Features** â†’ Optional; models automatically learn sequential patterns.
- **Cyclical Date Features** â†’ Sine/cosine encoding improves temporal awareness.
- **External Variables** â†’ Strongly recommended for improving forecasting accuracy.

### **Train-Test Split Steps:**
- **Train-Test Split (80-20)** â†’ Ensures the model is trained on past data and tested on future unseen data.
- **No Shuffling** â†’ Maintains time order for forecasting accuracy.

### **Outcome**
A dataset with engineered features that enhance model performance and a robust train-test split that respects the temporal structure of the data.

## ðŸ‘‰ Step 7: Baseline Forecasting Models
### **Objective**
Build **simple forecasting models** as an initial benchmark.

### **Models Included:**
- **Moving Averages**
- **Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters Method)**
- **Simple Regression-Based Forecasting**

### **Outcome**
A baseline set of models to compare with more advanced techniques.
