# ðŸ“Œ Demand Forecasting Project

## ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Aggregate the Data

### **Objective**
Convert raw transactional data into structured time-series format. This step ensures that data is prepared for forecasting models.

### **Aggregation Levels:**
- **Daily** â†’ Best for short-term forecasting, inventory planning.
- **Weekly** â†’ Useful for mid-term trend analysis.
- **Monthly / Quarterly** â†’ Helps in long-term sales pattern identification.

### **Outcome**
A structured dataset with consistent time intervals for accurate forecasting.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Handle Missing Values

### **Objective**
Identify and fill missing values in the dataset to prevent gaps from affecting model predictions.

### **Methods to Handle Missing Data:**
- **Interpolate missing values** â†’ Fill gaps between existing data points.
- **Forward Fill (ffill)** â†’ Carry forward previous day's sales data.
- **Zero-fill** â†’ Set missing values to 0 if SKU was not sold.
- **Impute using historical trends** â†’ Use rolling averages or seasonality-based imputation.

### **Outcome**
A complete dataset without missing values, ensuring consistency in model inputs.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Detect & Handle Outliers

### **Objective**
Identify and handle extreme values that could distort model performance.

### **How to Handle Outliers:**
- **Keep outliers** if they represent real demand (e.g., promotions, sales spikes).
- **Cap outliers** using Winsorization (limit extreme values to a threshold).
- **Use IQR Method** to detect and remove statistical outliers.

### **Outcome**
A cleaned dataset where extreme values are either treated or accounted for appropriately.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Transform the Data

### **Objective**
Convert non-normally distributed data into a more stable form to improve model accuracy.

### **Transformation Methods:**
- **Log Transformation (`log1p()`)** â†’ Reduces right-skewed distributions.
- **Square Root Transformation** â†’ Less aggressive than log, useful for moderate skewness.
- **Box-Cox Transformation** â†’ Applies a power transformation, works for positive values.
- **Yeo-Johnson Transformation** â†’ Handles both positive and negative values.

### **Outcome**
A dataset with normalized distributions that improve forecasting performance.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 5: Scaling the Data

### **Objective**
Ensure that all features have a consistent range to improve model training stability.

### **Choosing the Right Scaling Method:**
- **MinMaxScaler** â†’ Best for deep learning models (LSTM, RNN) and when features have a known fixed range.
- **StandardScaler** â†’ Ideal for normally distributed data, linear regression, and time-series models (ARIMA, SARIMA).
- **RobustScaler** â†’ Best for datasets with outliers, tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest), and robust regression.

### **Outcome**
A properly scaled dataset where all features are optimized for model training.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Step 6: Train-Test Split (Chronological Order)

### **Objective**
Split the dataset into training and testing sets while preserving the time-based sequence to prevent data leakage.

### **Steps:**
- **Train-Test Split (80-20)** â†’ Ensures the model is trained on past data and tested on future unseen data.
- **Visualization** â†’ Confirms that the split is correctly applied.

### **Outcome**
A robust train-test split that respects the temporal structure of the data.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 7: Baseline Forecasting Models

### **Objective**
Build **simple forecasting models** as an initial benchmark.

### **Models Included:**
- **Moving Averages**
- **Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters Method)**
- **Simple Regression-Based Forecasting**

### **Outcome**
A baseline set of models to compare with more advanced techniques.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Step 8: Statistical Models & ARIMA

### **Objective**
Implement traditional statistical forecasting models for time-series data.

### **Models Included:**
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**
- **Exponential Smoothing State Space Models**
- **Prophet (Facebook's Forecasting Model)**

### **Outcome**
A comparison of statistical forecasting models to establish accuracy and performance benchmarks.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Step 9: Machine Learning Models

### **Objective**
Use supervised learning techniques to improve demand forecasting.

### **Models Included:**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

### **Outcome**
A machine learning approach to forecasting, allowing for non-linear relationships and feature engineering.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 10: Neural Networks for Time-Series Forecasting

### **Objective**
Apply deep learning models to capture complex patterns in time-series data.

### **Models Included:**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Time-Series**
- **Transformer-Based Forecasting Models**

### **Outcome**
An advanced modeling approach for capturing deep temporal dependencies in demand forecasting.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 11: Model Evaluation

### **Objective**
Assess model accuracy using industry-standard performance metrics.

### **Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
- **RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

### **Outcome**
A quantitative comparison of model performance, guiding the selection of the best forecasting method for production use.
